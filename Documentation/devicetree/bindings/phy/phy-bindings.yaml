title: PHY device

description: >
  This document explains only the device tree data binding.  For general
  information about PHY subsystem refer to Documentation/phy.txt

required:
  - name: "#phy-cells"
    description: >
      number of cells in a PHY specifier. The meaning of all those
      cells is defined by the binding for the phy node. The PHY
      provider can use the values in cells to find the appropriate
      PHY.

optional:
  - name: "phy-supply"
    description: >
      phandle to a regulator that provides power to the PHY. This
      regulator will be managed during the PHY power on/off sequence.

example:
  - dts: |
      phys: phy {
          compatible = "xxx";
          reg = <...>;
          .
          .
          #phy-cells = <1>;
          .
          .
      };
    description: >
      Describes an IP block (PHY provider) that implements 2 different
      PHYs. In order to differentiate between these 2 PHYs, an
      additional specifier should be given while trying to get a
      reference to it.

required:
  - name: "phys"
    description: >
      the phandle for the PHY device (used by the PHY subsystem)
  - name: "phy-names"
    description: >
      the names of the PHY corresponding to the PHYs present in the
      *phys* phandle

example:
  - dts: |
      usb1: usb_otg_ss@xxx {
          compatible = "xxx";
          reg = <xxx>;
          .

          .
          .
      };
    description: >
       Represents a controller that uses two PHYs, one for usb2 and one
       for usb3.

  - dts: |
      usb2: usb_otg_ss@xxx {
          compatible = "xxx";
          reg = <xxx>;

          .
      };
    description: >
      Represents a controller that uses one of the PHYs of the PHY
      provider device defined previously. Note that the phy handle
      has an additional specifier "1" to differentiate between the
      two PHYs.
